# Colingz Template
January of 2019.

# My memories
This was challanging for me - 100%. Before I decided to work with this template, I've noticed that I would have to somehow add 3 different sliders with their oun specific traits on the page. At the beggining I had the crazy idea to code all the sliders from scratch. But than I quickly realized that it could take dozens of times and it the end I can get with misirable results and certainly break all the deadlines. So, I've decided to strengthen another skill - ability to work with other libraries. And I've chosen Slick as I think it perfectly suited my goal because it provides myriad of ways manipulating the behaviour and apperance of sliders.

The development was going fun. I've been taking time and carefully work on each small detail. It was cool making .
